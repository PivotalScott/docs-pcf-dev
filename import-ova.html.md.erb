title: Using a Local OVA with PCF Dev

This topic describes how to use PCF Dev with a local Open Virtualization Appliance (OVA). By default, PCF Dev tries to download a pre-determined OVA at startup. You can configure PCF Dev to import an OVA instead when Internet access is restricted.

1. Run `cf dev version` to determine the OVA version of your PCF Dev installation.

	<pre class="terminal">
	$ cf dev version
	PCF Dev version 0.19.0 (CLI: 27d4cda, OVA: 0.234.0)
	</pre>

	This command outputs the CLI and OVA version and the Git SHA of the CLI. In this example, the OVA version is `0.234.0`.

1. Download the OVA file.

	OVA files are available on the <a href="https://network.pivotal.io/products/pcfdev#/releases/1622">Pivotal Network</a>. To download the OVA, click on the corresponding file in the release, for example `pcfdev-v0.234.0.ova`. You must be signed in and accept the EULA to download the OVA.

1. Run `cf dev import PATH-TO-OVA-FILE` to import the OVA file. Replaces PATH-TO-OVA-FILE with the path to your downloaded OVA file.

	<pre class="terminal">
	$ cf dev import ~/Downloads/pcfdev-v0.234.0.ova
	OVA version 0.234.0 imported successfully.
	</pre>

	This command copies the OVA file into the `$PCFDEV_HOME` directory (`.pcfdev` in your home directory by default). You can only import the version of the OVA corresponding to the version of your PCF Dev CLI plugin. All other OVAs are deleted.

1. Navigate to the `$PCFDEV_HOME` directory.

1. Run `cf dev start`.
